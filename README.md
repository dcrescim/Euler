Problems
========

In this directory I have a bunch of solutions to various project euler questions in languages that I'm trying to master.

I've tried to name them with names that are more descriptive than "prob1" and "prob2", this way I can reuse chunks of code that I have written before.

For those with a slight taste of OCD (like me), it is easy to view the questions in number sorted order by using 'ls -l -h -v', the '-v' giving it a clean sorted look.

Also ldc2 (the D compiler I'm using) doesn't let me preface files with a number (hence they are at the end).

Anywho, have fun perusing at your leisure.
